            <p>We met just before CS111 started when Xiaolin introduced us to each other, and you looked so pretty. 
              I didn't know Xiaolin was friends with pretty people too. You looked happy, and so magnetic.

              We walked back to Slivka just during the World Cup, and my heart beat really fast. 
              Fuck the Brazilians. After a lot of back-and-forth to set date and location because you
              woudn't accept the steakhouse, we went to Cafe Coralie. It was so cold.

              We went to ramen place in Chinatown, and you were not able to teach me how to use chop sticks.
              The lady at the counter was rude, but I loved seating next to you the whole time.

              what exactly we were doing. I thought you were just playing with my feelings but I'm lame so I thought
              that couldn't be true. I guess you liked me back. Do you still?

            <h4>February 27</h4>

            <p> After less than a month dating, my mom popped into the US for some reason. I was so nervous; so
              glad she behaved okay. She loved you so much. We went to Shedd Aquarium, and 
              it was pretty, filled with weird animals. We ran to the bus at some point.
              Why do we always arrive late at museums?

            <p> Mononucleosis. Moment of infection for you; pain and suffering for me. Not being able to kiss you was so depressing.
              I missed you.

              but your family made me feel like I wasn't an outsider. Cece.

            <h4>March 31</h4>
            <p> Won't elaborate on this too much, but I wanted to say this a month into our
              relationship because I didn't have boundaries. Controlled myself so much. Sometimes
              my chest ached when I didn't say it, and so after a month of that I'd had enough. I 
              asked everyone about the timing. And I do love you, and that moment with you was perfect.

            <p> Seeing you dance is one of my favorite things. Dance forever. You're so good and in sync and 
              you always look so confident and happy. I wish I could see it nonstop.
