            outside of Tech. You made me nervous. I just wanted to make a good impression on

            seemed to be such a larger force, so pretty and kind that I couldn't ever talk to you.
            After this, I was obsessed with you. I'd never met people I couldn't get tired of hearing
            about. You made me play set, and feel welcomed.

            I remember making up an excuse so I could sit near you, and I'm sorry for speaking
            so loudly that day. After ramen we had boba, and after boba, we watched Better Call Saul, 
            and I was more sure than ever that I really liked you. You seemed so angelic when you slept,
            and so pretty, and my heart melted every time I looked over at you.
